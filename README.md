# Python in the Browser, and what does it mean for Data Science

## Abstract

Since announcing PyScript in May, weâ€™ve seen an outpouring of support, encouragement, 
and creativity as users begin to test whatâ€™s possible when Python is unleashed in the browser. 

PyScript has the potential to dramatically change the way in which data science can be delivered 
and democratized, but getting there takes many steps. In this short talk, Valerio will try to 
provide the gist of what PyScript is, how it works, and how this could be useful for 
data science with practical examples.

## Slides

Slides of the talk are hosted on this repo, and made available via **Netlify**:
