# Data visualisation in the browser with PyScript

## Abstract

[PyScript](https://pyscript.net) is a new [open source](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript) 
framework that enables the creation of rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's 
interface and the power of [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), 
[WASM](https://webassembly.org/), and modern web technologies. 
Running Python directly in the browser has the great potential of completely change the way in 
which Data Science can be delivered and democratised, using browsers as ubiquitous computational platforms. 
Data Visualisation is perhaps one of the most impactful scenarios in which PyScript can 
demonstrate its full potential, enabling seamless integrations of the Python/PyData stack with 
native Javascript libraries (e.g. `d3.js`). 

In the first part of my talk, I will introduce the core features of PyScript, along with a 
general description of how it works, and how the project is positioned within front-end 
technologies' ecosystem. Afterwards, I will showcase several examples of  `data-viz` apps using 
multiple libraries, demonstrating how PyScript can bridge the gap between Python and Javascript 
for complex data use cases.
