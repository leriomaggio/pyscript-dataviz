# Rethinking Data Visualisation Apps with PyScript 

## Abstract

PyScript has the great potential to change the way in which 
Data Science can be delivered and democratised completely. 

Running Python directly in the browser, you can really get the 
experience of running Python _anywhere_, _any time_, using 
the browser as a ubiquitous virtual machine. Moreover, its
native integration with Javascript simplifies the way in which 
these two technology can finally interact, bringing the .

Data Visualisation is perhaps one of the most impactful scenarios in 
which PyScript can have its say. PyScript enables the creation of 
self-contained interactive `data-viz` apps, leveraging on the full 
Scipy/PyData stack, along with other well-known JS library like `d3.js`.

In the first part of my talk, I will introduce PyScript, its growing 
ecosystem, and some of the main features which are particularly 
relevant from a data science perspective. 
Afterwards, I will showcase several examples of 
`data-viz` apps using multiple Python and Javascript libraries, 
demonstrating how PyScript can change the way in which interactive 
visualisation apps can be designed and delivered for complex data use cases.
