# Rethinking Data Visualisation Apps with PyScript - Talk @ PyData London 2022

PyScript has great potentials to changing the way in which Data Science can be delivered and democratised completely. 

Running Python directly in the browser, you can really get the experience of running Python anywhere, any time using the browser as a ubiquitous Virtual Machine. 

Data Visualisation is the first and perhaps the most straightforward process in which PyScript can have its say. In fact, PyScript enables the creation of self-contained interactive data viz apps, bringing the full Scipy/PyData stack directly integrated with _interactive_ data visualisation frameworks, e.g. `bokeh` or `panel`. There's more! PyScript also allows direct integration with Javascript, enabling the development of full-fledged data viz apps using well-known JS library like `Altair` or `D3.js`

In this talk, we're going to introduce PyScript and we will present how PyScript can change the way data visualisation can be designed and delivered for complex data science use cases.
